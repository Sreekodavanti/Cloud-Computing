## Direct Marketing with Amazon SageMaker XGBoost and Hyperparameter Tuning (SageMaker API)
Supervised Learning with Gradient Boosted Trees: A Binary Prediction Problem With Unbalanced Classes.

### Problem
Direct marketing campaigns are used to acquire customers via phone, email, or other communication channels. However, not all potential customers are likely to engage with an offer. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit at a bank based on historical data from previous campaigns. This helps optimize marketing resources by focusing on likely prospects.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from UCI's Bank Marketing dataset, which includes:

Features: Demographic, social-economic, and previous interaction data, such as age, job, marital status, previous contacts, and more.
Target: A binary label indicating whether the customer subscribed to a term deposit (yes or no).
The data is imbalanced, with a higher number of negative responses, which makes it an ideal use case for advanced techniques like XGBoost and hyperparameter tuning.

### Approach
The project utilizes Amazon SageMaker to build and deploy a binary classification model using the XGBoost algorithm, a gradient-boosted decision tree technique that works well with unbalanced datasets.

Key Steps:
Data Downloading: Data was downloaded from an S3 bucket.
Data Transformation: Data preprocessing was performed to handle missing values, normalize features, and create a balanced training set using techniques such as oversampling and SMOTE.
Setup Hyperparameter Tuning: Used SageMaker’s built-in hyperparameter tuning to explore a range of parameters for the XGBoost model, improving the accuracy of predictions.
Launch Hyperparameter Tuning: The hyperparameter tuning jobs were executed on SageMaker-managed infrastructure, ensuring scalability.
Analyze Results: Post-tuning, the results were analyzed to identify the optimal set of parameters.
Deploy The Best Model: Deployed the model with the best hyperparameters to a SageMaker endpoint for real-time predictions.

### Techniques
Supervised Learning: The model was trained using labeled data (yes/no responses).
Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost): A powerful algorithm particularly suited for structured/tabular data and handling unbalanced classes.
Hyperparameter Tuning: SageMaker's built-in hyperparameter optimization was utilized to systematically explore the best combination of parameters.
SageMaker API: The entire process, from training to endpoint deployment, was managed via the SageMaker API, ensuring reproducibility and scalability.

### Solution
Model Creation: The XGBoost model was trained using SageMaker’s API, leveraging AWS’s distributed computing power.
Hyperparameter Tuning: SageMaker’s automated tuning was employed to optimize key parameters like eta, max_depth, subsample, and min_child_weight.
Endpoint Deployment: The best-performing model was deployed to a SageMaker real-time endpoint, enabling quick and scalable predictions.

The project successfully built and deployed a machine learning model to predict whether customers would subscribe to a bank’s term deposit. By leveraging SageMaker’s hyperparameter tuning and endpoint deployment capabilities, the solution was both scalable and cost-effective, optimizing resource allocation for direct marketing campaigns.
